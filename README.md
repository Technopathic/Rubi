# Rubi

Rubi characters are small superscript texts placed above or to the right of normal text. These characters are common in East Asian writings and serve a purpose in adding an extra pronunciation guide for unfamiliar readers. After seeing a [twitter post by @mabelandtee](https://twitter.com/mabelandtee/status/1381043149125074946), I developed a ReactJS concept component to deliver a similar result as Rubi characters, but for English.

## FAQ

### Will this support other writing systems?
Not sure. I have some experience in multilingual websites, but I'm open to contributions. 

### Why the name "Rubi"? It's really similar to the "Ruby" programming language. 
No relation. "Ruby" or "Rubi" is just what it's called. I could have gone for "Ruby" but yeah, I'm pretty certain that's been taken.

### Why did you build this?
I liked the concept and figured myself and other people would find it useful. 

### Do you profit from this?
Nope. Would appreciate a follow, though.

### My Rubi characters are overlapping?
The Rubi text will require that you have a `line-height` set for your content. I've found that `line-height: 32px` works best at minimum.

### Does this support mobile?
It does.

### This looks kind of weird?
Of course. This isn't a standard in English writing systems. But it certainly makes it more interesting. 

### Can I contribute to this?
Yep. Make that pull request.
